# Texts & Human experiences

### reflection paragraph:
"The sun will move on, and I will simply watch." The widower in the country is a poem about the human experience of grief that almost all of its audience can relate to. As pretty much everyone in the world has experienced some form of grief,  


The individual human experience of grief is explored throughout Les Murrays poem *Widower in the Country*. An anomaly is something that differs from the expected, for example a puppy being pink from a black breeding chain. Powerful literature explores a main anomaly through its media form, with the anomaly in the poem Murray's poem being the fact that the widower himself doesn't end up leaving his bed, he simply plans out his melancholy day. The title of the poem describes the context for the character Les writes about, with which he has a physical connection to the role. His father was a widower, so Les had first hand experience at seeing the impact losing someone so important had on his fathers life. 

This text invited me to see how profound of an impact grief can have on people, with the main character seemingly being stuck towards the end of his grief, but definitely the most potent part of grief: depression/acceptance. By showing me how majorly impacted the widower feels by this loss, it makes me appreciate the fact that I haven't experienced anywhere near a similar degree of grief in my life. The text has expanded my views around how people's lives are affected by those around them, teaching me about how valuable the current moment in time really is to us, and everyone around us. Perhaps this text is inviting us, the audience, to realise that time is precious, and we should be grateful for every second we have with those we love alive around us.

The individual human experience of grief is explored throughout Les Murrays poem _Widower in the Country_ by his use of anomalies. Powerful literature explores main anomalies through its media form, the anomaly in Murrays poem being the fact that the widower himself doesn't end up leaving his bed, and simply plans out his melancholy day. The title of the poem describes the context for the character Les writes about, a role he has physical connection to. As his father was a widower, Les had first hand experience seeing the impact that losing a loved one had on his father’s life. Les himself was married until his death in 2019, so he himself was never a widower, but by seeing the impact that grief had on his fathers life he writes a compelling piece of poetry about grief, and how dangerous it can be if left untreated.

This text allowed me to perceive the profound impact grief can have on people by means of the main character, a person seemingly stuck towards the end and yet most potent moments of his grief, depression and acceptance. By displaying the characters’ retaliation and actions towards their loss as well as the impact they felt, I am able to appreciate the fact that I haven’t experienced anywhere near a similar degree of grief in my life. Furthermore, through exploring the impacts of grief, Les has invited me to see the world differently in the fact that everyone around us is important for every minute of our days. We should be appreciative of what and who we have today, and focus on the now rather than the past or future.

Hand in a 250-300 word reflection on one of the human experiences in your related text. Use the following
questions to scaffold your reflection.
1. What anomalies, inconsistencies and/or paradoxes are explored in your related text?
2. How has this text invited you to see the world differently?
## Texts Definition:

Texts are a vehicle through which we share experiences. Texts are shaped by experiences and they shape experiences. It’s through texts that we encounter and understand human experiences. This is, therefore, a study of the way texts share or represent experiences.

  

## Discuss:

1. What makes us human?

2. What is an ‘experience’?

3. Can human experiences be individual or collective?

A Poison tree (william blake):
I was angry with my friend;
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did grow.

And I watered it in fears,
Night & morning with my tears:
And I sunned it with smiles,
And with soft deceitful wiles.

And it grew both day and night.
Till it bore an apple bright.
And my foe beheld it shine,
And he knew that it was mine.

And into my garden stole,
When the night had veiled the pole;
In the morning glad I see;
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.

1. How has the poem been structured? What’s the impact of this?
Rhyming paragraph in the form AABB
2. Discuss and annotate together what happens in each stanza
In the first stanza, the author has anger, some of which is relieved some of which stays. In the second stanza, the author discusses more of the emotions inside his mind, comparing them to water and sunlight for a plant. In the third stanza, the “tree” - that being the anger and negativity inside his mind, starts to grow, and it bears fruit - perhaps the anger leading the author to do something bad. In the final stanza, the “foe” - the person William has anger against, dies underneath the tree, perhaps signaling Williams anger has dissipated
3. Annotate what you think the following represent in the poem:
	1. Watering
	Containing more emotions internally, bottling them up alongside the anger
	2. Sunning
	Fake emotions being displayed externally, helping the internal feelings gain merit
	3. The apple
	The culmination of Williams anger/wrath, pushing him to do something to the “foe”
	4. The death of the foe
	The anger leaving Williams mind, or perhaps william doing something to the foe himself physically
	5. The garden
	Williams mental scape, that being where all his emotions are contained
	4. Annotate the key language/poetic techniques in the poem AND their effect.
	Rhyme - enhances the flow of the poem, metaphor - provides food for thought for the audience, symbolism - Blake’s mind is a garden, and his negativity is a tree
	5. What is the main human experience that Blake is exploring in this poem?
	The feeling of being wronged, or experiencing anger towards another person
	6. Why is Blake better off using figurative language to write about this experience?
	By using figurative language, Blake allows the reader to interpret their own meaning from the poem, based off the readers own human experiences.
	7. Do you agree with Blake’s views? Why/Why not?
	I agree with the fact about the mind being a garden, when you take care of your mental state you reap the garden, that being happiness and equality (?)

  

Activity: THE LAB: REFLECT - Getting personal with portraits

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YNj_KpkAf0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YNj_KpkAf0)

What is the point of this video and how does this connect to ‘Texts & Human Experiences”?

It shows us the amount of thought put into each photo taken, sort of leading into the fact that every record we leave behind should be thought about. Emotional thing - everything that people have gone through is always specific to one person, everyone reacts differently.

  

The African Begger (Raymond Tong):

Sprawled in the dust outside the Syrian store,
a target for small children, dogs and flies,
a heap of verminous rags and matted hair,
he watches us with cunning reptile eyes,
his noiseless, small-poxed face creased in a sneer.

Sometimes he shows his yellow stumps of teeth
and wines for alms, perceiving that we bear
the curse of pity; a grotesque mask of death,
with hands like claws about his begging bowl.

But often he is lying all alone
within the shadow of a crumbling wall,
lost in the trackless jungle of his pain,
clutching the pitiless red earth in vain
and whimpering like a stricken animal.

GOT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WORDS YOU’RE USING MEAN

The one lie [John](Quotes#^b7197b) Proctor's wife gives ends up killing [John](Quotes#^b7197b), she tries to save his reputation and in turn destroys her own

The experience of fear, a common collective and individual human experience, permeates the play as many of the characters hold genuine fears for a range of reasons.

Even the location of salem, isolated on the edge of a forest fed these fears. The forest was seen as the domain of the devil, and therefore a dangerous place.
### Human experience; revenge:

1. Define revenge
Revenge is the act of taking action against someone or something who you feel has wronged you in some way

2. Why do you think revenge is such a common human experience? Do you think it is more likely to be an individual experience or a collective one? Why?
A large number of people believe in the “eye for an eye” mentality - that if somebody wrongs you, you should wrong them with the same severity, so you’re both equally wronged.

   3.i. Ann putnam: Who does Mrs Putnam want revenge against and why?
Betty - throwing her under the bus as a demon first chance, Tituba - probably race, Rebecca - belief that rebecca caused the miscarriages by midwifing,  

  3.ii Thomas Putnam: who does he want revenge against and why?
“He was a man with many grievances” - narrator, “this man is killing his neighbours for their land!” - giles
“A moment, Mr Proctor. What lumber is that you’re draggin’ if i may ask you? … Why, we are surely gone wild this year. What anarchy is this? That tract is in my bounds, it’s in my bounds, Mr Proctor.”
He is mad against the town, generally for land disputes and things relating to power, Proctor - over a land dispute, Giles and danforth - still around land, and who can claim it

  3.iii. Abigail: Elizabeth Proctor - Married to [John](Quotes#^b7197b) Proctor who Abigail wants to marry and so sees Elizabeth as competition
P26 - all the girls are trying to say we should stop now before we get too deep into the accusations
P30 - wants elizabeth gone so she can have [John](Quotes#^b7197b) Proctor to herself
P60 - Elizabeth talking about [John](Quotes#^b7197b) not blaming abigail
P70 - 
P96 - 
Mary - Mary is trying to prove Abigail wrong and so to preserve her name she denies Mary. 
‘I know not. A wind, a cold wind, has come.’ 

# Crucible notes:

## Film notes:

Movie starts in dark location, with girls dancing around a fire in the forest. The girls are “casting” love spells - likely just 

Trials in court: hysteria, mass hysteria, girl saying she can’t faint again, there was no spirits but there was, the story is shifting constantly

Lies - witch hunts - story changing

Man crushed to death is historically accurate: [https://www.masshist.org/beehiveblog/2021/09/giles-corey-pressed-to-death/](https://www.masshist.org/beehiveblog/2021/09/giles-corey-pressed-to-death/)

Bringing the total death count up to 13 thus far, 12 by hanging 1 by crushing. 

[John](Quotes#^b7197b) tears his signed confession, invalidating the document
## Play notes:

- Miller uses repetition of “i saw … with the devil” as the curtains are closing are falling
## Context:

LI: We are learning about human experiences in The Crucible and how these experiences are represented.

SC: 
- I can identify key aspects of the context of the play - both Miller’s 1950’s America & Salem 1692 and how Miller connects these two contexts. (viewing the videos and making notes from LMS)
- I can explain the purpose of the play (from notes on LMS)

[McCarthyism](Glossary#^dc5591):
- Joseph McCarthy was a member of the american parliament, he used privilege to make baseless accusations against citizens of america being communists 
- By having privilege he can’t be sued or defamed for the accusations made in session 
- Arthur Miller was accused, and didn’t give up any names to save himself, mainly because he didn’t go to the meetings 
- Gave more power to the capitalist mindset, as everyone was thinking capitalist as they got grilled by HUAC
Historical accuracy:
- Man who was crushed to death with stones was real

Cold war:
- Period of threatened violence between communist east and capitalist west (1945 - 1991)
- Communism is all organised differently to capitalism (humility vs greed)
- Timeline:
	- 1945: end of WW2, start of cold war
	- 1947: Checks conducted on the loyalty of US government workers (ARE THEY COMMUNIST??)
	- 1949: Mao Zedong proclaims China a Communist nation (USSR assisted)
	- 1950 - 1953: period of heightened ideological aggression by the USA against Communism (everyone becomes afraid of being called a communist)
	- 1950: Senator McCarthy claims 205 people in the U.S. State Department are members of the communist party
- HUAC (House Un-American Activities Committee) asked many Americans “Are you now, or have ever been a member of the Communist Party?”
- “The Other” - someone belonging not in this community (demon calling)
## Techniques:

Adultery:
- [John](Quotes#^b7197b) with [Abigail](Quotes#^3539e8)

Dramatic irony:
- [John](Quotes#^b7197b) reciting 10 commandments, ignoring the one he hasn’t kept (adultery)

Stage directions:
- Convey the sense of fear and panic, denoting mood

Symbolism:
- Black/White, Light/Heavy, etc.

Setting:
- Puritan New England, 1692
- Each act is set in one setting - offers four different views of Salem e.g. orderly calm of the Proctor’s home contrasts the emotional chaos of Parris’ home
- Right on the dark woods (the indians) representing the unknown (where the devil is) church is the centre, Proctor on a farm therefore on the outside
- The setting highlights the life and death struggle, raising the stakes of the play

Characterisation:
- Characters are conventional. They are individually and collectively represented. (sympathy and engagement with the characters) Almost all of the main characters are represented in very human with flaws and strengths

Dialogue:
- Believable dialogues for the C17th Puritans; convincingly old fashioned without being hard to understand. Partly based on research from Salem court records. Apart from a few words, such as ‘harlot’, the vocabulary is essentially modern. Miller achieves this by echoing the language of the King James Bible - linking words in unusual ways, using double negatives, changing verb tenses.

Farce:
- The girls clambering over the pews, saying the “birds” have a face of whoever

Allegory: 
- Salem witch trials used to warn audience about dangers of McCarthyism
- Narrator argues that “political inspiration of the Devil” began centuries before the witch trials - the Spanish inquisition, Martin Luther. This extends the allegory to be about the dangers of “mob mentality and unchecked political authority”
## Language forms and features in the crucible:

Goal: to understand the ways language is used to shape representations in texts

Dramatic form: 
- Acts and scenes
- Stage directions
- [Authorial Intrusions](Glossary#^caf53e)
- Action
- Gestures
- Facial expressions
- Dialogue
- Sound Effects
- Lighting
- Costume
- Props
- Scenery
- Paradoxical settings
- Character conflict (eg [John Proctor](Quotes#^b7197b))

Language features:
- Historically authentic language
- Some archaic language (some has been modernised)
- Double negatives
- Theological Language/jargon/terminology
- Legal language/jargon/terminology
- Character specific diction e.g. Danforth speaks more formally than those from Salem
- Foreshadowing
- Used quite frequently throughout the play. Despite a range of audience members assumedly knowing the historical context of the Salem Witch Trials, Miller employs this technique often throughout the play

- Symbolism    
- Hot and cold
- Documentation and books
- Poppets
- Crucible
- Colours: black, white and red

## Post exam slide show T1 2024
3 elements in the question: *how effectively* does The Crucible and one related text *tell stories* to *communicate challenging experiences*?

Thesis: language of the question and Miller's purpose
Topic sentence: need to be clear and connect to your thesis (so therefore must be answering the question)
Conceptual understanding? Know the rubric - understand the complexities of human experiences - motivations, emotions, qualities, inconsistencies, paradoxes, anomalies, collective, individual...

Essay should work with only the topic sentences, they state the case then body filler argues it.
Analysis should be detailed, short and frequent quotes with regular analysis of form and features
Insightful = perceptive, conceptual + informed

Majority of essays need to be 800-1000 words: Practise. Argument cannot be sustained in 2-3 pages. This marking was done generously. 
Muscles need to be trained to write 3 hours straight

# Essay writing
## Using the TEEL structure:
Well structured paragraphs are important because if the information is well organised it is easier to read.
The TEEL strategy is very helpful for knowing what should be included in a paragraph:
- Topic sentence (contains the main idea is usually first in the paragraph)
- Explain
- Evidence and example (use references)
- Link (refer back or sum up main idea) - optional

Example paragraph:
What anomalies and paradoxes are there in the Crucible?
T: Paradoxes are an effective method of an author communicating a message with their audience. 
E: Within storytelling, an author writes a text to convey a meaning towards the audience, often a collective human experience. 
E: Within the crucible, Arthur Miller writes about a paradoxical historical event, the Salem witch trials. Within a Puritan (christianity-aimed religion) village, the Devil is a major scare to the citizens. The paradox within the Trials that Arthur explores is one around how a Puritan village leads themselves to turn against each other, involving the human experience of power, and how it can corrupt people. Reverend Hale believes he is immune to the Devil, yet ends up becoming worried only with keeping his own power, and his reputation over the other villagers.
L: By exploring how paradoxical the witch trials were, Arthur Miller writes an effective text explaining how power can corrupt.

## Module B: Close study of literature

### What makes the Truman show distinctive?
Cameras being hidden on scene, but shown to the audience
A twist on dramatic irony where the cast knows what's happening but Truman doesn't -- every single thing in Trumans world has been thought about, set design, costumes etc




## Truman Discussion
This **film** is a **simulation** that manipulates **truth**
The Truman show is about **true/fake human relationships**
The Truman show is a **superficial journey** for **entertainment** that is **fake**

All of these sentences have the shared idea of truth

Overall throughout the movie Truman goes on the **Hero's Journey - quest for truth** 
- Truman is manipulated throughout the film to make Truman do what they want him to do
- Phones akin to drugs, social media a fake world almost like how Truman is in a fake world


Don't structure the video essay like an essay, structure it like a persuasive clearly set out text

## Video essays
Aim for 4-5 minutes in length, think of it as a normal essay with added layers of visual detail. We will be marked on the essay, not as much so the visual part. Aim to make it almost exactly 5 minutes. 
There are 2 levels of assumptions in the truman show: kristoff (truman director) and peter wier (film director).
### "Why the truman show is a wonderful movie"
- What is the main argument **in each video** essay?
The entire movie has been so carefully put together that Jim Carrey should deserve an award, and the movie should be recognised by more people
- What are TWO techniques or examples referred to that are sophisticated or especially interesting?
The hidden cameras constantly mentioned within the film, almost a 4th wall break (the whole movie is a 4th wall break regardless)
Truman acts very "TV-like" due to growing up with TV personas his whole life
- What are TWO new ideas about TTS as a whole that you got from the videos?
It is similar to other movies at the time, so perhaps something was going on in society at the time
Truman is unable to distinguish the reality of the show from the reality he goes into
- What are TWO new concepts or terms that you need to research?
The camera lens point of view
Ubiquitous 
- What are TWO video essay techniques that you found helpful (that the videos utilised)?
Classical music in the background: can add focus to the authors words
A mix of video and text screens throughout the presentation
- What references were made to cultural assumptions'?
The style of the town Truman lives in
The housing dynamic where Truman works and his wife cooks
## Cultural assumptions
Something that society normally perceives as being true, "this is the case"
NESA definition: Beliefs or attitudes about such things as gender, religion, youth, age, disability, sexuality, social class and work *that are taken for granted as being part of the fabric of the social practices of a particular culture*. Cultural assumptions underlie cultural expressions in texts and may also be embedded in texts in various ways.

Only Truman appears to notice how artificial the world is. His whole world is built on cultural assumptions, it's been built so that Truman will enjoy it (safe and happy) and the directors can make money. 
### [Platos cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave)
If you were born inside a box, would you ever consider a world outside it that is more real? Plato asked this in the allegory of the cave. Imagine a group of people chained facing a wall, they only see shadows from light, so they believe that shadows are real. 
The world as we perceive it comprises of imperfections. (video from 8 bit philosophy)
### Christof's statements
One of Christof's final statements to Truman: "There is no more truth out there than there is in the world I created for you. The same lies, the same deceit. But in my world, you have nothing to fear." 
This was written before social media. It also includes a cultural assumption that the world is full of lies.

Christof: He could leave at any time. If his was more than just a vague ambition, if he was absolutely determined to discover the truth, there's no way we could prevent him. I think what distresses you, really, caller, is that ultimately Truman prefers his cell, as you call it.

"We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented. It's as simple as that."
### Truman's assumptions
Truman makes assumptions about how dangerous the outside world and the ocean is. His assumptions are supported by media in his world.
He is blocked by media:
- This could happen to you at travel agent
- Sunken boat in water at ferry
- "Show me the way to go home" tv show
### Normal lives: assumptions/advertisers
Lots of friends, school, good grades, lots of out of school activities, have a job (Maccas/fast food) \[stable income]
Advertisers:
- Job
- Friends
- Social experiences
- Diets
- Phones/gadgets
- Travel
- Cars
- Easy
- Middle class
- YOU NEED MORE
### Seahaven assumptions
The town is created to represent the **American Dream**. Wealthy, middle class suburban life with the blonde wife and children. The white picket fences are symbolic. Also, the retro **fifties** aesthetic. The film has many stereotypes to show this "normal life".
Christof even refers to it as a "normal life".

All the families are wearing clean, conservative pressed and ironed clothes. 

Lauren/Sylvia: Look at what you've done to him!

Christof: I have given Truman the chance to lead a normal life. The world, the place you live in, is the sick place.

#### Consumerism and materialism
Are deconstructed through the more and more intrusive product placement. Usually **product placement** is supposed to be **subtle** so that we are not aware we are being targeted for advertising.
Weird starts using more obvious and silly techniques like fast zooms, exaggerated facial expressions (sentence unfinished)
### Assessment task:
Think about any cultural assumptions embedded in the idea and scene you have chosen. Remember that the cultural assumptions that Christof has in the world of Seahaven, are not the cultural assumptions that Weir necessarily supports. (para unfinished)

Example:
In this scene, the underlying cultural assumption that the ideal, normal life should include marriage, a nice house and a steady, responsible job is reinforced through the clean, bright lit views we have of Seahaven and Truman's role within it. (para unfinished)
### Assumptions worksheet
1. Think of the overall plot of the film. What is the film saying is good
and evil?
The film is saying that the outside world is evil, and that living a lie is good
- What does the film assume is most important in life?
Living a fulfilling life: that is a life where you have a good job and a nuclear family
- What important decisions does Truman make?
The ending part (sailing onto the ocean), following his wife to work, being distrustful of the world he is now in
- What do these decisions tell us about what the filmmakers think is right and wrong?
The film makers think that it is right to follow their world that has been created for Truman, yet Truman disagrees and tries to escape it.

Chosen scene: Roundabout crazy
2. Does the scene assume anything about what it means to be a man or a woman or how men and women should relate?
Yes, it assumes that a woman should listen to her husband and offer advice, not do anything actively to try and stop him. 
3. Does the scene assume traditional male and female roles? (eg. Men should be strong, take the lead, earn income for the family; women should be focused more on the home.)

4. Does the scene assume that the traditional and established ways are best or that we need to change more and embrace new ways of doing things?

5. Does the scene assume there is a God or that religion matters or does it assume that God and religion are not relevant to the character’s life.

Surfer poem starts with calm - then turns around into a warning, go home swimmer

[The poem](https://allpoetry.com/The-Surfer)

## 3D reflection for Surfer poem
### **Describe**: what have we done in these lessons?
Throughout the lessons on the Surfer by Judith Wright, we have explored the meanings behind the poem, including personification techniques around the sea, how it acts as muscles, as a wolf. 
### **Disclose**: declare your conceptual understanding of the relationship between the ocean and humans as represented in *The Surfer*
The relationship between ocean and humans in the surfer is that humans are weak, yet can go into the sea, and work either with it or against it. By working with the ocean, a surfer becomes one with it, muscular, fluent, liquid.
### **Decide**: how do you feel about this approach?
This approach was unique, at first the multiple read throughs of the poem were a bit irritating, although after extending the poem I can see why we read through the poem multiple times initially.

She's providing both a positive and a negative message on the ocean in one poem -- almost saying to respect the ocean
7. Write a 20 line analysis of the poem. Begin with what you think is the main idea or theme. Be sure to include the impact of voice and imagery in your analysis. You may also include content, context, structure, title and tone.
First stanza focuses entirely on the surfer, while the second stanza is a warning/push to send the surfer home, and the third stanza wraps it up explaining why the warning was given. The main theme in my opinion would be the idea of working alongside or appreciating nature, while still respecting the dangers it can hold. The author (Judith Wright) chose to almost provide a voice to nature, with lines such as "turn home swimmer" seeming to be from the point of view of either a seagull, or the land warning the swimmer.
The punctuation in the poem is brief, yet it provides a flow to the story, almost how the ocean has a flow that the surfer can work along with. 
## Explain the following
Stanza 1:
i) Muscle of arm thrust down long muscle of water;
This line is the poet talking about the surfer contending/pushing against the ocean, muscle for muscle by personifying the ocean, yet saying they are as 1 because they both are muscles.
Stanza 2:
ii) Turn home, the sun goes down; swimmer, turn home
The ocean/narrator is imploring the surfer to head back, mentioning how the sun has set and the swimmer, not even the surfer anymore, should turn back, turn home
iii) Last leaf of gold vanishes from the sea-curve
This uses imagery to compare the sun to a gold leaf, saying that the sun is gold/wealth, and the wealth has left the sea, further asking the swimmer to head back, there is no wealth there for him anymore
Stanza 3:
iv) For on the sand the grey-wolf sea lies, snarling,
v) one of your own choosing
## My rewrite of the poem
As I cast off into the blue;
climbing against the waves, drifting through the spume,
(grinning, as the cold water sprays my face)
my skin, glistening under the salt water
pushing against the waves, I take my board further out
deeper than ever before, prepared to face the new waves

the sun falls beyond the horizon
I start to turn back, paddling to the shore
catching one last wave to carry me closer

## An experiment on a bird in the air pump
**The point of view of the bird**:
Pressure. Subtracting, crushing, aching inside my head. My feathers, ruffling in the breeze pulling, *escaping* from beneath me. 
A weak cry emits from my beak, the intruders outside looking on with interest. They poke, they stare. Some of them are sad, crying over what the old one is doing with the pump. 

My neck starts to give out, my lungs burning as the air is stolen from my body. My tongue starts to burn, water being turned to steam, my eyes blurring.

Throwing myself away from the pump, I hit a wall. Again, trying to escape, I hit a wall. Walls everywhere, surrounding, trapping, like a net, holding me near this danger. 

Throwing my head into this invisible net's base, I try one last time to escape, before my body begins convulsing, and I can't stop it, and I can't make it stop, and I can't...
