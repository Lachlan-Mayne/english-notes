## Logarithmic calculus

$g(x)=a^{f(x)}$
$g'(x)=ln_a*f'(x)*a^{f(x)}$

Differentiate $y=x^x$
Take natural log of both sides: $\ln{y}=\ln{x^x}$
Use log law to take power out front: $\ln{y}=x\ln{x}$
Differentiate both sides: $\frac{y'}{y}=\frac{d}{dx}x\ln{x}$
= $\frac{y'}{y}=x\frac{1}{x}+\ln{x}$
Multiply by y to make y' the subject: $y'=y(x\frac{1}{x}+\ln{x})$
sub in the value for y: $y'=x^x(x\frac{1}{x}+\ln{x})$
Simplify: $y'=x^x+x^x\ln{x}$

## Solving Equations

When solving equations, there are normally two main methods:
### Algebraic solving

### Graphical solving
When solving $f(x)=g(x)$:
- the number of solutions is the number of points of intersection of $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$.
- The solutions are the $x$-values of the points of intersection
When solving $f(x)>g(x)$:
- the range of $x$-values where $y=f(x)$ is above $y=g(x)$
$f(x)<g(x)$
- the range of $x$-values where $y=f(x)$ is below $y=g(x)$

## Transformations of functions & graphs
***Dilation before translation***. Order of vertical and horizontal doesn't matter.
Function f(x) is vertically dilated by factor k, then translated by c ($y=k\times{f(x)}+c$) 
Function f(x) is is horizontally dilated by a factor of $\frac{1}{a}$, then shifted by $-b$ units. NOTE: a is factored ($y=f(a(x+b))$)
Combined together, $y=kf(a(x+b))+c$ : Vertical dilation by $k$, horizontal dilation by $\frac{1}{a}$, shifted direction opposite to the sign of $b$, shifted up or down by $c$.
### Asymptotes of graphs:
#asymptotes
$y$-intercepts when $x=0$
$x$-intercepts when $y=0$
Consider the equation: $$h(x)=\frac{g(x)}{f(x)}$$
Vertical asymptotes where denominator $f(x)=0$
Horizontal asymptotes are found through **limiting behaviour**, $\lim \limits_{x \to \infty} f(x)$, divide throughout $h(x)$ by highest power in $f(x)$. p
Test if the function is even by subbing in $f(-x)$

#### Examples:
- horizontal:
	$f(x)=\frac{2^x+1}{2^x-1}$
	as $x$⇒-∞, $2^x+1$ --> 1 & $2^x-1$ -> -1
	horizontal:
	$f(x)=\frac{\sqrt{16x^2-8}}{2x-5}$
	Divide throughout by 1/x
	=$\frac{\sqrt{(16x^2-8)*\frac{1^2}{x^2}}}{2-\frac{5}{x}}$
	=$\frac{\sqrt{16-0}}{2-0}$
	=$\frac{4}{2}$
	=2
	∴horizontal asymptote at y=2 for positive values of x

# Trigonometry
To graph, use caps
$f(x)=ksin(b(x+c))+d$
C: Centre ($d$)
A: Amplitude ($|k|$)
P: Period ($\frac{2π}{b}$ if sin/cos, $\frac{π}{b}$ if tan)
S: shift ($-c$ units)

Solving trig eqns:
$y=sin(x)$
RAA: related acute angle, $sin^-1(|y|)$ - then find quadrants using ASTC (all positive, sin positive, cos positive, tan positive)
Simplify equations initially before working on 




Vertical:
$f(x)=\frac{x}{x^2-4}$
= $\frac{x}{(x+2)(x-2)}$
∴asymptotes at x=±2, as denominator ≠ 0
DISREGARD vertical:
divide by the highest power in denominator
$f(x)=\frac{x}{x^2-4}$
$÷x^2$
=$\frac{\frac{x}{x^2}}{\frac{x^2}{x^2}-\frac{4}{x^2}}$
=$\frac{\frac{1}{x}}{1-\frac{4}{x^2}}$
as $x$ becomes bigger, 1/x becomes smaller. Same with $4/x^2$
apply a limit as x approaches 0:
= $\lim \limits_{x\to\infty}$ , $\frac{1}{x} \rightarrow 0$
= $\frac{0}{1-0}$
=$0$
Whenever there is a power on the bottom of the fraction larger than the top, doing the above process will always result in 0
