Description of the uses and sources of ammonia:

Ammonia is one of the most used chemical compounds in the agricultural industry. It is commonly used to create fertiliser, with around 80% of all ammonia created used to make fertiliser (https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/emergency/chemical_terrorism/ammonia_tech.htm). It can also be used in refrigeration systems, as a coolant gas, as well as used in the purification of water. 
Uses:
-       Fertiliser
-       Explosives
-       Used in other synthesis reactions 
-       Refrigeration systems
-       Pharmaceuticals
-       Paper production
-       Cleaning liquids
Sources:
-       Haber process
-       Decomposition of organic material such as waste matter/gases
-       Forest fires

Description of the Haber Process and its importance
The Haber process is the synthetic production of ammonia, using the below formula:
$$N_{2(g)} + 3H_{2(g)} ⇌ 2NH_{3(g)}$$
$$ΔH = -92kJ/mol$$
As the reaction uses the ⇌ symbol, it is an equilibrium reaction. This means that the reaction is going both forwards and backwards at the same time, eventually reaching a point where the two rates are equal - an "equilibrium point". When this point is reached, to any observers it seems as if the reaction has reached completion, yet it has not, there is just enough of each side being made that the amounts of each doesn't seem to change. 

The Haber process was initially invented during world war 1, as the British blocked the Germans from getting their ammonia imported from Chile. As their ammonia source was blocked off, the german scientists had to discover a way to generate it themselves, or the germans would eat through all of their stored crops. While the citizens were starving to death, Fritz Haber discovered the way to synthesise ammonia, which was then named the Haber Process. Haber discovered this mainly for fertiliser, but as Germany was a major party in the current war, they used the ammonia generated to help create german weaponry; explosives.

Explanation of the effect of changing the temperature on the haber process (including collision theory and Le Chatalier's Principle)

The temperature of a system has a major impact on whether a reaction favours moving to the left, or the right side of the equilibrium. As the Haber process is exothermic, $ΔH$ is negative, heat is given off on the forward side of the reaction. By adding temperature (heat) to the system, the reaction moves more towards the left side (reverse reaction), as by Le Chataliers principle the system will aim to minimise the effect of that change. To put it differently, to minimise the increase of heat, the system will move to the side that has less heat, which in the Haber process is the reverse reaction. 

Collision theory states that for a product to form, the particles of the reactants must collide. The more heat there is in a system, the more the particles within move.
