## Widower in the country:
I'll get up soon, and leave my bed unmade.
I'll go outside and split off kindling wood
from the yellow-box log that lies beside the gate,
and the sun will be nigh, for I get up late now.

I'll drive my axe in the log and come back in
with my armful of wood, and pause to look accross
the Christimas paddocks aching in the head



Widower: husband who's wife has passed away
