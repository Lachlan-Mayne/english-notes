Cont. from [[Nov 08, 2023#Opening]]
### Opening
- PARRIS: there is a faction that is sword to drive me from my pulpit. Do you understand that?
- Motivation: Parris' daughter is sick or in shock at the start of the play. We are not shown the scene, but it appears that some of the girls were dancing and doing 'magic' in the forest.
- Notice how Parris is more concerned about the political power place than anything supernatural
	- author making point that the politicians leading the [McCarthyism](Glossary#^mccarthyism) are worried more about their own status & power, than actually finding communists
### Abigails Reputation
- Parris challenges Abigail about her reputation in the village. Notice how he uses symbols and metaphors
- "Your name in the town - it is entirely white, is it not?"
- The puritans in the play tend to speak in binaries. A **binary** is where something is on or off, black or white, good or evil. There are no grey areas.
