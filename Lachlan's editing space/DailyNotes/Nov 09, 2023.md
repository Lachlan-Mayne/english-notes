# POEM IS ANTI WAR
### It is good and fitting to die for your country


Cont. from [[Nov 08, 2023#Opening]]
### Opening
- PARRIS: there is a faction that is sword to drive me from my pulpit. Do you understand that?
- Motivation: Parris' daughter is sick or in shock at the start of the play. We are not shown the scene, but it appears that some of the girls were dancing and doing 'magic' in the forest.
- Notice how Parris is more concerned about the political power place than anything supernatural
	- author making point that the politicians leading the [McCarthyism](Glossary#^mccarthyism) are worried more about their own status & power, than actually finding communists
### Abigails Reputation
- Parris challenges Abigail about her reputation in the village. Notice how he uses symbols and metaphors
- "Your name in the town - *it is entirely white*, is it not?"
- The puritans in the play tend to speak in binaries. A **binary** is where something is on or off, black or white, good or evil. There are no grey areas.
	- Language technique: always using and speaking in binary. (symbols and metaphors are very one or the other sided, not three ways or more)
### Abigail and the Girls
- Abigail has power over the other girls and seeks to make them **conform** to her plan. The girls lose their **individual freedom** to maintain **unity** in their false story.
- Notice the use of binary language again: "I will come to you in the black of some terrible night and I will bring a pointy reckoning that will shudder you" - Abigail
	- Binary language, "black"
- Motivation: fear, desire to conform
### Proctor's Fall
- We are introduced to Proctor as a **fallen** man. He has sinned with Abigail and almost destroyed his marriage.
- This is the central problem of the play that will eventually be resolved in Proctor's **redemption**. He will not find redemption through the church or Christianity.
	- Miller: "These people had no ritual for the washing away of sins"
	- Proctor finds redemption through coming to acceptance with his own sins
### Morality and Passion
- Proctor represents the **human struggle** between morality and passion. Should he follow his feelings and desires or should he restrain himself to do what is right?
- Miller represents this struggle through the ***binary symbol*
