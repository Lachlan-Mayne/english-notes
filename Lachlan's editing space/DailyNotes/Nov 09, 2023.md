Cont. from [[Nov 08, 2023#Opening]]
### Opening
- PARRIS: there is a faction that is sword to drive me from my pulpit. Do you understand that?
- Motivation: Parris' daughter is sick or in shock at the start of the play. We are not shown the scene, but it appears that some of the girls were dancing and doing 'magic' in the forest.
- Notice how Parris is more concerned about the political power place than anything supernatural
	- author making point that the politicians leading the McCarthyism are worried more about their own status & power, than actually finding communists
