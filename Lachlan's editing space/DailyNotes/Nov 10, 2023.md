### Danforths confidence
- The judge, Danforth, believes that he can clearly see the truth. Miller uses *dramatic irony* to challenge the assumption that humans can always see the truth clearly. The audience knows that he is being deceived by Abigail and the girls
	- Dramatic irony is the audience knowing something but the characters don't
- Danforth: "This is a sharp time, now, a precise time - we live no longer in the dusky afternoon when evil mixed itself with good and befuddled the world."
### Elizabeth's Lie
- Elizabeth is placed in a *moral dilemma*. She is forced to choose between exposing her husband's sin to an unjust and wicked community OR lying and committing perjury
	- A dilemma is where you must choose between two equally undesirable options
	- Will Elizabeth tell the truth and ruin her husband, or ruin herself and lie?
- The dilemma challenges our assumptions about easy choices between a **binary** of good and evil
### Proctor's Confession
- Finally, all the pretence is stripped away and Proctor fully accepts his **guilt** and sin. And he is also accepting his death and judgement. In doing this, he also sees the judgement coming on Salem
	- This is almost a climax point in the play
- "A fire, a fire is burning! I hear the boot of Lucifer, I see his filthy face! And it is my face, and yours, Danforth! ... you know in all your black hearts that this be fraud - God damns our kind especially, and we will burn, we will burn together"
	- Proctors judgement on Salem/Danforth
### Drama and Reflection
- Miller uses this climax in the play to prompt the audience to reflect. We know how Proctor feels, but does Danforth know that the witch trials are a fraud?
- *Ambiguity* is where there is doubt about what is true or false. We are never told if Danforth believes in the trials. Is Proctor right about Danforth? Leaving this question *ambiguous* prompts reflection in the audience
	- Does Danforth believe in the trials??
### The final dilemma
- Miller continues to challenge the audience to reflect by presenting them with the **final dilemma**:
	- Hale argues that Proctor should lie, confess to being a witch, and save his own life
		- Hale is saying the hunts are a lie, that Proctor should follow it
	- Elizabeth supports him whatever he chooses because "Only be sure of this, for I know it now: Whatever you will do, it is a good man does it"
		- Tied in with foreshadowing earlier, Proctor saying whatever you see in me see a good man
		- I know it now, not known from before, Elizabeth has changed her view on Proctor
### Proctor's Choice
- The difficulty of the dilemma is represented by Proctor vacillating
	- vacillating: moving from one side to the other
- He finally chooses, *symbolically* tearing up his confession
- This choice emphasises the importance of removing **pretence** and being **truthful**
