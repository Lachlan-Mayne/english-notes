SDD assessment:

- Design elements (glossary):
	- Ergonomics: the study of the relationship between human workers and their work environment
	- User support, including help screens and other forms of user training and assistance, is another area of ergonomic software design that requires consideration
	- User Interface: the screen designs and connections between screens that allow the user to communicate with software

- Setting standards and stick to them. **Set design standards based on industry standards** and then develop **extra standards specific to your application and user's needs**. Most operating system developers have sets of design standards; these standards will often define much of the design.
