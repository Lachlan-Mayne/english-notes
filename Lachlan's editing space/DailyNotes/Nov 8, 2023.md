SDD assessment:

- Design elements (glossary):
	- Ergonomics: the study of the relationship between human workers and their work environment
	- User support, including help screens and other forms of user training and assistance, is another area of ergonomic software design that requires consideration
	- User Interface: the screen designs and connections between screens that allow the user to communicate with software

- Setting standards and stick to them. **Set *design standards* based on industry standards** and then develop **extra standards specific to your application and user's needs**. Most operating system developers have sets of design standards; these standards will often define much of the design.
- **Explain the rules**. Develop a simple set of rules that apply to your **entire application**. In this way, you will need to explain your rules only once. This makes more sense than explaining the details of how to use each individual feature of your application.
- Use interface elements correctly. Know when to use screen elements and how to use them correctly. For example, **command buttons, check boxes, radio buttons, list boxes, text boxes, menus**, etc. Follow ***recognized standards*** for each of these elements. Never alter the operation of standard screen elements to perform unexpected functions.
- **Use colour appropriately.** Colour should be used sparingly. Colour is viewed differently by individuals, what looks pleasing to you may be abhorrent to others. **Don’t override a user’s system settings**, they chose them and your application should not override their choices. This ensures **consistency** between applications. Ensure you maintain sufficient contrast between text and backgrounds.
- Use fonts appropriately. The use of fancy fonts can decrease usability considerably. Use fonts that are easy to read. Don’t override system settings for standard fonts. More than three fonts on a single screen are too much. Use fonts consistently, there should be a reason for font changes and the reason should be immediately and consistently clear. Remember you are using a different font every time you change the size, style, typeface or colour.
- **Alignment of data entry elements**. Text boxes should be left justified with their associated labels also left justified. For columns of data, **right justify integer, align decimals to the decimal points** and **left justify text**.

Design standards based on industry standards:
- first thing
- second thing
- third (?)
Extra standards specific to your application and users needs.

Set of rules that apply to your entire application
- Don't exit menu $x$ until you've done $y$ 

Visuals:
- consistency in fonts
- consistency in colours
