# Data Science for sport
- Sport analytics is a sub-branch of data science
Data science is a new field of study, combining:
- Computer programming
- statistics
- exploratory data analysis & visualisation
- Data extraction, cleaning & transformation
- Machine learning & artificial intelligence

Types of data used include:
- Individual performance
- Team performance
- Wearable sensors (smart watches, bike computer)
- Video

It involves binomial probability:
If we have a number of $n$ events with only two possible outcomes, governed by a probability $p$, we say that a random number $x$ has a Binomial distribution

Unfinished Example:
Flipping a coin 5 times
Probability 0.5 heads
$P(x=2)=\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!}\times(\frac{1}{2})^2$ unfinished line, teacher skipping

In sport, the probability of winning is unknown, so an estimation is calculated, which is known as *maximum likelihood estimation*.
Example: hawks won 1/5 past games, therefore MLE is $p=\frac{x}{n}=\frac{1}{5}=0.2$

We want to choose $p$ that maximises the function $\binom{5}{1}p^1(1-p)^4$
MLE can be done using calculus, e.g. with logs to calculate
e.g. $\ln{P(x)}=\ln{\binom{n}{x}}+x\ln{p}+(n-x)\ln{1-p}$
Then can be derived to find maximum point
Flaw with this method:
- if team hasn't won any games, the probability would be 0

Ability scores:
Imagine the probability of $p_{i,j}$ of team $i$ beating team $j$ depends on the relative abilities of the two teams, $a_i$ and $a_j$
Ability scores aren't constant, they can change throughout the season
- Ability scores were originally invented for the Elo system in chess (Zermelo 1928, Elo 1978)
- Universal Tennis Rating (UTR)
- English premier league: `alt-3.uk`
- `Rugbyleagueratings.com`
- Microsoft Xbox live (trueskill ranking system)

Duckworth-Lewis method is a way of determining who has won a game of cricket if the game is cancelled due to rain. It is calculated by combined resources over overs remaining, and has a somewhat exponentially decreasing graph

Wearable sensors (in cycling) are used to measure the Power (in Watts) generated by cyclists on the same track

The bachelor degree of Data Science and Analytics:
New degree launched in 2020
- 3 years full time

# Recent cybersecurity trends on the internet
## What is cybersecurity?
Online/offline, digital securing of data/information
Username/password are used to protect a computers software.  

With a house, security involves locks, security cameras, reinforcements etc. A variety of approaches is used to protect a house, smart/analog devices. 

Definition:
Cybersecurity can be considered as a collection of systems, tools, processes, practices, concepts and strategies that are used to prevent and protect the cyber space from unauthorized interaction by agents with elements of the space and to maintain and preserve the confidentiality, integrity, availability and other properties of the space and its protected resources (Le, N.T and Hoang, DB. 2017)

Example:
Ransomware:
- finds their way to a computer, encrypt all the relevant data and ask for a ransom to send the key needed to decrypt the data
- The function of ransomware is to cause damage to data or electronic devices and gain an advantage by disrupting services
- In this case, it requests a ransom to be paid in order to restore access to data, in other words, to fix a problem that it has created

Returning to the definition, a cybersecurity expert will need to have knowledge of coding, problem solving, fundamental knowledge of IT/computer systems, researching skills (up to date knowledge)
## Why do cybersecurity?
interests in security/computer systems/consulting
## Information gathering
Gathering information can lead to finding a weakness. There are two main methods of gathering: 
Passive:
- google
- shodan
- robtex (domain lookup & info)
- netcraft
Active:
- Nmap
- Zenmap
- Spatar
- Scanner
The way to defend against each:
Passive defense:
- Limit public information
- Modify server error messages
Active defense:
- Disable unused ports
- Firewall
- Honeypots
- IPS

## Capture the flag (CTF)
Cybersecurity is related to how you can find the weakness of the system. It is like the game called CTF - Capture the Flag

Your task is to **Find the flag** with format (xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx):
Guideline:

- You will see the picture Mr Janitor
- Hint 1: view the html source code of the page
- Hint 2: find the flag with the above format from the source

# Uncover hidden mysteries in data
Business analytics: What is it?
"Business analytics refers to a broad use of various quantitative techniques such as statistics, data mining, optimisation tools, and simulation supported by the query and reporting mechanism to assist decision makers in making more informed decisions."
There are 3 main types of modern business analysis:
- Statistics
- Business intelligence/information systems
- Modeling and optimisation

It covers different industries:
- retail
- banking
- government
- insurance
- utilities
Some examples of business analytics: customer transaction behaviour, supply chain, forecasting, spending optimisation, collection prediction, churn, fraud detection, bad debt prediction, cross-sell/upsell, loss estimation, risk analysis, segmentation, money laundering, anomaly detection.
