### Symbols

- The days running counter draws a similarity to people stuck in prison

## Fake Things:
- City
- People
- Weather

## Flashback Scene:
- Lots of cuts between Truman and Sylvia
- Focus on Sylvia's eyes (reference to him trying to create the person with the scraps)
- Forced entry from Meryl
- Shows progression between Meryl and Truman
- Truman still has feelings for Sylvia when he sees her at the dance
- Crew trying to force there to be minimal romantic connection between Truman and others by removing her from the dance
- Sylvia is forced to make Truman do something spontaneous with her as otherwise it's too easy to remove her from the show, and thus removing all possibility of a connection with him
- Sarcasm with Sylvia to show interest
- Love triangle between Sylvia, Meryl, and Truman

Individual can’t break free (the media always controls to some extent)

## Good thesis:
- Can be argued against
- High modality words/trigger words
- Statement of what you are arguing
- A single sentence
- Must cover a lot of information from the film
- Must be able to prove it from the film
- A statement you could say to someone in public


## Thesis:
The human desire for finding the truth will surpass those who oppose it.

## Cultural Assumptions:
- Can tell the difference between a theme and an assumption
- Can detect when Weir is drawing attention and challenging our assumptions
- Can detect when Weir is just taking things for granted. I do not use the word "challenging"
- Can write a brief comment on a cultural assumption
- Can use language that reflects less certainty
- Use the phrase "cultural assumption"
- Only humans have culture (animals don't)
- Cultural assumptions are beliefs or attitudes about such things as gender, religion, youth, age, disability, sexuality, social class and work that are taken for granted as being part of the fabric of the social practices of a particular culture
