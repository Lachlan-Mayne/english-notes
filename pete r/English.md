## The Truman Show
- Bridge is a metaphor for being trapped
- Flashbacks used to provide backstory for fear
- Trauma from his dad dying in the past while on the beach
- Multiple levels: Truman level (his normal life), and people watching him (security guards, audience etc)
- Meta: a thing about a thing (a movie about a movie, book about a book)
- Peter Weir (director) introduces meta-commentary
- Flashbacks are incorporated through symbolism (jumper)
- Days running has a subtle reference to being in a prison
- Call to adventure, meeting of goddess is when he meets Sylvia (where his obsession with Fiji starts)
- Truman starts finding out more when he doesn't show up for work (breaking out of the status quo)
- Crossing fingers on the wedding day
