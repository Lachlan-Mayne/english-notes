Description of the sources and uses of ammonia

Ammonia is produced in soil from bacterial processes
Ammonia is also produced commercially via the Haber process

##### Sources of Ammonia:

- decomposition of organic waste matter
- forest fires
- animal and human waste
- 
##### Some uses of ammonia include:
- fertiliser
- refrigerant gas
- purification of water
- cleaning solutions:
	- household cleaning solutions 5-10% ammonia
	- industrial use is 25% ammonia and corrosive
- manufacturing of various goods such as:
	- plastics
	- explosives
	- textiles
	- pesticides
	- dyes

The optimal conditions for ammonia synthesis via the Haber process requires pressures around 150–200 atm and temperatures around 500 °C
