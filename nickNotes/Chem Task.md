Description of the sources and uses of ammonia

Ammonia is produced in soil from bacterial processes
Ammonia is also produced commercially via the Haber process

##### Sources of Ammonia:

- decomposition of organic waste matter
- forest fires
- animal and human waste
- 
##### Some uses of ammonia include:
- fertiliser
- refrigerant gas
- purification of water
- cleaning solutions:
	- household cleaning solutions 5-10% ammonia
	- industrial use is 25% ammonia and corrosive
- manufacturing of various goods such as:
	- plastics
	- explosives
	- textiles
	- pesticides
	- dyes

The equation for the Haber process:

N2+3H2 ⇌ 2NH3

The optimal conditions for ammonia synthesis via the Haber process requires pressures around 150–200 atm and temperatures around 450 °C. An iron based catalyst is used and the molar ratio for nitrogen and hydrogen is 1:3 respectively.

Le Chateliers Principle states that a system at dynamic equilibrium will change to partially oppose a disturbance. When heat is added or removed from a dynamic equilibrium reaction the forward or reverse reaction will be favoured according to Le Chateliers Principle. The Haber process is an exothermic reaction, this means the forward reaction releases heat. If the temperature of the reaction is increased then the backwards reaction would be favoured to decrease heat, producing more nitrogen and hydrogen. If the temperature of the reaction is decreased then the forward reaction would be favoured to oppose the decrease in heat and create more heat, producing more ammonia. An increase in temperature not only leads to a favouring of a certain side of the reaction, but also leads to an increase in the rate of reaction. Collision theory states that for a chemical reaction to occur, the reacting particles must collide with one another. When the systems temperature increases and more heat is present, the particles in the system will become more agitated and move around the system quicker. Because the particles are moving around the system quicker they have many more chances to collide with one another and cause the reaction to occur, therefore speeding up the rate of reaction.
