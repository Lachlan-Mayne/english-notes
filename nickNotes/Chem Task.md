Description of the sources and uses of ammonia

Ammonia is produced in soil from bacterial processes
Ammonia is also produced commercially via the Haber process

##### Sources of Ammonia:

- decomposition of organic waste matter
- forest fires
- animal and human waste
- 
##### Some uses of ammonia include:
- fertiliser
- refrigerant gas
- purification of water
- cleaning solutions:
	- household cleaning solutions 5-10% ammonia
	- industrial use is 25% ammonia and corrosive
- manufacturing of various goods such as:
	- plastics
	- explosives
	- textiles
	- pesticides
	- dyes

The equation for the Haber process:

N2(g)+3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)

(Website name) states that the optimal conditions for ammonia synthesis via the Haber process requires pressures around 150–200 atm and temperatures around 450 °C. An iron based catalyst is used and the molar ratio for nitrogen and hydrogen is 1:3 respectively. In Industrial Chemistry the optimal conditions are not able to be met because they are not feasible for the reaction, so the pressure that they use is 2 atm. 

Le Chateliers Principle states that a system at dynamic equilibrium will change to partially oppose a disturbance. When heat is added or removed from a dynamic equilibrium reaction the forward or reverse reaction will be favoured according to Le Chateliers Principle. The Haber process is an exothermic reaction in the forward direction, this means the forward reaction releases heat. If the temperature of the reaction is increased then the backwards reaction would be favoured to decrease heat, producing more nitrogen and hydrogen. If the temperature of the reaction is decreased then the forward reaction would be favoured to oppose the decrease in heat and create more heat, producing more ammonia. An increase in temperature not only leads to a favouring of a certain side of the reaction, but also leads to an increase in the rate of reaction. "Collision theory states that for a chemical reaction to occur, the reacting particles must collide with one another". When the systems temperature increases and more heat is present, the particles in the system will become more agitated and move around the system quicker. Because the particles are moving around the system quicker they have many more chances to collide with one another and cause the reaction to occur, therefore speeding up the rate of reaction. While Increasing the temperature may not be beneficial for the yield of ammonia, the reason the optimal temperature is 450°C is because the reaction rate will increase.

The next condition for this process is pressure/volume changes. Pressure and volume are inversely proportionate, so when pressure is increased, volume is decreased and if you decrease the volume of a system then the air inside of it will become more and more compressed. Pressure change causes an initial change in concentration for the entire reaction because the particles are being compressed into a smaller system. Pressure/volume change can only change the initial concentration if the reaction is gaseous. Pressure increase causes an equilibrium reaction to favour the side which has less gaseous moles so as to oppose the initial increase in pressure. This also happens vice versa when the pressure is decreased and the reaction favours the side with more gaseous moles to increase the concentration and oppose the decrease in pressure. When pressure is increased in the Haber process equilibrium reaction, according to Le Chateliers Principle, the concentration of the entire system will be increased. This means the reaction will oppose the disturbance and favour the reaction that produces less gaseous moles, in this case being the ammonia with it having 2 moles of NH3 for 4 moles of N2 and H2 combined. This increase in pressure will cause the yield of ammonia to be much higher. While increasing pressure can be done for a much higher yield, the initial increase in concentration is also done for a higher reaction rate. Increasing the pressure of the system means the initial concentration of the entire system will be much higher. A change in concentration means there are more particles present in the system close together. This means that more particles have a chance of colliding with each other and progressing the reaction quicker. The reaction progresses quicker initially, but as time goes on the system will become less concentrated and the reaction will eventually reach equilibrium again. Because of the reaction rate increase and the yield increase, the optimal condition for pressure is 200 atm which is very high and would achieve both these things. 

The concentration of the process is also a very important factor to consider because, according to Le Chatelier's Principle, having an excess amount of reactants would favour the forward reaction therefore making more products. And the opposite is true when you add more products, then the backwards reaction would be favoured and you would end up with having more products. Having an excess of either products or reactants would push the reaction in the opposite direction. Because of the difficulty of getting N2 and H2 from their sources, Industrial Chemists still use a 1:3 molar ratio for the nitrogen and hydrogen reactants (talk about the ways to obtain these gases). This is also because, if the reaction were to contain more reactants, then the reaction would not completely react and waste excess hydrogen and nitrogen in the process. Nitrogen is sourced from the air around us and Hydrogen is sourced from mainly natural gas, methane. 

Adding a catalyst to an equilibrium reaction is a way to increase the reaction rate. For the Haber Process, the catalyst that is mainly used is iron (Fe) to increase the reaction rate of nitrogen and hydrogen. The catalyst for the Haber Process isn't just iron, it has a bit of potassium hydroxide added to it. Iron is used because it is very cheap and it works well in the Haber process. In Industrial Chemistry, the Haber Process is done on a very big scale so having a cheap catalyst that works well is very useful to perform on this scale. Another reason iron is favoured as a catalyst is that the process occurs at high temperatures and scales that iron is able to be used at. Another reason is that iron is able to exchange bonds with the nitrogen and hydrogen in the reaction, speeding up the rate of reaction. Without the iron catalyst the reaction would move so slow that the reaction doesn't happen in a realistic amount of time to mass produce, the addition of a catalyst makes it so that a dynamic equilibrium can be set up fairly quickly. Le Chatelier's Principle does not apply to a catalyst because it does not affect the direction of the equilibrium in any way.

There are many reasons why the optimal conditions for the synthesis of ammonia are these values, but if they are vastly changed in any way, they may make the entire reaction inefficient as a result. The optimal conditions for the synthesis of ammonia is very energy intensive, costly and dangerous, so on an industrial level it is not feasible. 200 kPa is the most optimal for feasible use

- LCP: lower temp favours exothermic because it releases heat
- collision theory -> particles to collide, sufficient energy
- collision theory favours higher temp for higher kinetic energy therefore they are contradictory
- overcome activation energy barrier
- more kE --> overcome EA
- 400-500 degrees celsius is a midpoint for collision theory and LCP
- decrease product push forward reaction 
- isolate the diatomic nitrogen in the air (78%) through liquefaction
- get hydrogen from methane 
- don't do excess products because they don't want to waste 
- catalyst!! - Fe: d orbitals, empty/unpaired to make lots of bonds in the iron catalyst and rearrange bonds with the nitrogen and hydrogen speeding up the reaction process
- talk about how some of Le Chatelier's Principle isn't feasible for industrial chemistry
