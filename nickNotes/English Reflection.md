An Irish Airman Foresees His Death by W.B. Yeats explores the paradox of the airman's motivation, challenging human experiences. The airman is differentiated from the norm as he does not feel any motivation from most of the things that soldiers usually get motivated by. Yeats uses the repetition of the words "Those that I" followed by contradicting statements, allowing us to see that he doesn't fight out of hatred and he doesn't protect out of love.

What stood out to me was the line "Nor public men, nor cheering crowds", as many others are swayed by the thought of fame and reputation that comes with serving your country and the praise that you get after coming back. This also made me think of the sense of pride that normal soldiers have when they server their country and the patriotism that we all feel. Thinking about these things made me question
