#### 1. Operations Strategies

Through their effective use of operations strategies, Qantas has shown that they are able to sustain a competitive advantage as a result. This is seen through multiple examples of leading edge and ex

##### 1.1 Technology

Qantas' use of operations strategies have been shown through their use of leading edge technology and established technology alike, which have allowed for them to allow longer flights and more comfortable and enjoyable flying for customers. Leading edge technology is a huge factor when considering if a company has a competitive advantage. Leading edge technology is any technology that is not already present in the industry and is new and innovative. This technology is hard to make and implement but can have very influential effects when a company has a competitive advantage or not. If you have leading edge technology that helps automate a certain process or make it easier, then you will have a competitive advantage over your competitors who do not have this. In terms of leading edge technology, Qantas is now starting to use biofuel for certain aircrafts, "Over the next ten years, the airline will purchase eight million gallons (30 million litres) of renewable jet fuel each year from US based bio-energy company, SG Preston" (Qantas News Room). This will allow Qantas to reduce their carbon emissions with a more environmentally friendly fuel and appeal to stakeholders. Qantas is using all these methods of leading edge technology to sustain a competitive advantage over competing airlines and still seeking to innovate more so that they can stay at this advantage in the future.

Qantas has used many forms of established technology throughout their time that many airlines use to stay in the loop of technology that will give them the best chance at success. Established technology is good for staying equal with other airlines in terms of technological advancement so that an airline will be able to stay relevant with all of the changing technology around. An example of existing technology at Qantas is the use of wifi on aircrafts while flying, this has been around for a long time and Qantas wasn't the first to use it but they use it so as not to get overtaken by airline who do use it and for better customer satisfaction. Another example of existing technology is the ability to make hot food on the plane and eat it while flying. This is an example of when the existing technology is essential for the growth of the business, as being able to order food on the aircraft and eat it in the air means that flights would be able to go on for longer and the trips taken by the aircraft would become more efficient with less stopovers. There are still many ways Qantas can make innovations in the amount of food that they can store and the quality of the food but that isn't their main focus in their leading edge technology.

##### 1.2 Supply Chain Management

Qantas uses their supply chain management to differentiate from their competitors by taking it very seriously and being very transparent about their goals and values. Qantas uses their "Supply Chain Assurance" program which states that "Qantas takes a proactive approach to managing risks in our supply chain. We have established systems and processes to ensure our suppliers (or the partners we work with) prioritise safety and sustainability in the same way we do."(Qantas, Our Governance). This program makes sure that all of Qantas' suppliers comply with their regulations and harbour the same ethical values as they do. They "support over 3,100 suppliers from all around Australia"(Qantas, Our Community) and make sure these suppliers comply with their regulations. Qantas has a plethora of different regulations and rules for suppliers to comply with.

#### 3. Corporate Social Responsibility

Corporate Social Responsibility in the Qantas group is highly valued by the company and ensures that the company has its priorities on doing whats ethically right for the environment. Qantas' Sustainability framework is "aligned to our strategic priorities and focuses on three key principles - valuing our planet, enabling our people and connecting customers and communities - to support our vision of driving sustainability to protect the future of travel." (Qantas, Acting Sustainably). In alignment with this Qantas have provided a sustainability report for the year to document progress made towards their "environmental, social and governance targets"(Qantas, Acting Sustainably). They were the second airline to make a goal of net zero by 2050, and they want to commit to sustainability in the future. 

An example of this being the biofuel that they are using in their aircrafts; this example of leading edge technology greatly follows their Corporate Social Responsibility. Some of their many other initiatives include "10% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in fuel mix by 2030, average of 1.5% fuel efficiency improvements to 2030, zero single-use plastics by 2027 and zero general waste to landfill by 2030" (Qantas, Valuing Our Planet). These initiates shows that Qantas care about the environment and their responsibility to care for it as a very influential business in the aviation industry.
