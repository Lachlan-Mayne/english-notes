Poem: An Irish Airman foresees his Death
By William Butler Yeats

	I know that I shall meet my fate
	Somewhere among the clouds above;
	Those that I fight I do not hate,
	Those that I guard I do not love;
	My country is Kiltartan Cross,
	My countrymen Kiltartanâ€™s poor,
	No likely end could bring them loss
	Or leave them happier than before.
	Nor law, nor duty bade me fight,
	Nor public men, nor cheering crowds,
	A lonely impulse of delight
	Drove to this tumult in the clouds;
	I balanced all, brought all to mind,
	The years to come seemed waste of breath,
	A waste of breath the years behind
	In balance with this life, this death.
