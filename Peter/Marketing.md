**Marketing involves identifying consumer wants and developing goods and services to satisfy those wants**

## Strategic Role of Marketing
The long-term process of implementing a marketing mix to satisfy the needs and wants of customers to enable the business to increase sales, and market share, and thereby achieve long-term profit maximisation

## Approaches to Marketing:
**Production Approach:**
Focused on the production of G&S and was popular from 1820s to 1920s.
The attitude towards marketing at the time was explained by a common catchphrase "If we make it, they will buy it."

**Selling Approach:**
Following WW1, technology went through another boom and production increased beyond demand. Different brands of goods became available where there used to be monopolies, so each business had to persuade consumers to buy their product over competitors. The needs of the consumers were still not researched or taken into consideration when developing the product.

**Marketing Approach:**
Following WW2, marketing more as we know it today started to surface. The customer was placed at the centre of marketing and production activities and businesses were finally researching the needs of the consumer and catering for them. For the first time, it was common for households to have disposable income, which allowed them to purchase to these G&S. "Customer first, product second."

**Marketing Approach Stage 2:**
This approach is evolving; different aspects of a business are showcased in order to gain consumer support. For example, CSR is one area where consumers may engage if it is environmentally friendly. Customer orientation, after-sales being offered is part of the product marketing.
Relationship marketing aims to develop a long-term relationship with customers through marketing strategies such as loyalty programs.

## Types of markets:
**A market is a group of people or organisations which:**
- Need or want a product
- Have the money to buy the product
- Are willing to spend their money on the product
- Are socially and legally authorised to purchase the product

**Resource Markets:**
- In the primary sector
- Raw materials
- Agricultural resources
- Sell to industrial markets

**Industrial Markets:**
- Where production of G&S happens
- Secondary sector
- E.g. Wheat from resource market made into bread in industrial markets

**Intermediate Markets:**
- Purchasers of finished goods from wholesalers to individuals
- E.g. A business buying from another business to sell to individuals
- Selling to someone who will sell it to end user

**Mass Markets:**
- Aim to sell to the larger population
- Selling to anyone who would buy it

**Consumer Markets:**
- Purchased to sell directly to consumers
- Woolworths
- Selling directly to end user

**Niche Markets:**

## Influences of Marketing:
**Factors influencing customer choice:**
- Psychological
	- Internal characteristics of an individual that influence their behaviour
	- Motivation, perception, learning, beliefs and attitude, lifestyle, personality and self-concept
- Economic
	- Influences business's capacity to compete and a customer's willingness and ability to spend
- Government
	- Governments use economic policies to influence the level of economic activity
	- Depending on the prevailing economic conditions, the government will put in place policies that expand or contract the level of economic activity
- Sociocultural
	- Exerted by other people and groups that affect customer behaviour
	- Social class, culture and subculture, family and roles, or peer groups
	- Socioeconomic influences the type quality, and quantity of products a customer buys. People from a high socioeconomic status background, for example, are usually willing to buy products that are perceived to be prestigious

**PEGS and QANTAS:**
- Qantas responded to a desire to save money through their implementation of Jetstar
- For consumers motivated by comfort, safety, and reliability, Qantas play up their reputation as one of the safest airlines
- Qantas recognises that consumers are affected by economic activity changes, and they act accordingly to maintain their customer base
- Qantas put marketing strategies on hold during COVID, however when trans-tasman bubble opened, they immediately were on it
- When flights resumed they had sales to encourage people to resume flying
- Qantas uses leverage of socioeconomic status by branding Qantas/Jetstar accordingly (Qantas more prestigious and older, Jetstar more down to earth and younger audience)
- Qantas partnering with influencers to increase their brand strength

## **Consumer laws:**
- A single, national consumer law (ALC) 2011:
	- Enforced by the ACCC
	- Mirror protections in the ASIC act enforced by ASIC
	- Applied by the state and territory consumer agencies as state and territory laws
- ACL applies in the same way to all Australian consumers and businesses regardless of where the business operates or where consumers shop
- Competition and consumer act 2010; has 2 major purposes:
	- Protecting consumers
	- Protecting and ensuring competition is fair
- Breaches of consumer laws can result in the ACCC taking legal action against the business or individual concerned

**Price Discrimination:**
- A business setting different prices for a product in different markets
- Can be for multiple reasons, sometimes valid:
	- Markets are geographically separated, such as city and country prices
	- Product differentiation within the one market, for example different electricity prices for domestic and business users
- Can't give favourable treatment to one market for no reason
- Example: UBER
	- Uber uses route-based pricing, which charges customers based on what it predicts they're willing to pay
	- An algorithm uses data and predicts the top price a user would be willing to pay
	- One of the biggest predictors of customer price sensitivity to a surge is how much battery they have left on their phone
	- Uber knows when is users phone batteries are running low because the app switches into power-saving mode

**Implied Conditions:**
- The unspoken and unwritten terms of a contract
- Are assumed to exist regardless of whether they were especially mentioned or written into a contract
- The most important implied term relating to customer purchase refers to the products acceptable quality
- A product is of acceptable quality if it is fit for the purpose for which it is being sold, acceptable in appearance and finish, free from defects, safe, and durable
- A warranty is a promise by the business to repair or replace faulty products

**Deceptive and Misleading Advertising:**
- Bait and switch
- Country of origin
- Packaging
- Special offer
- Dishonest advertising
- Tests and surveys
- Before and after advertisements
- Fine print

## **Ethics:**
- Critics of marketing argue that the industry does not always adopt ethical issues
- Creation of needs - materialism
- Use of sex to sell products
- There is often an overuse of sexual themes connotations to sell products
- Stereotypical images of males and females
- Men using power tools, women cooking or cleaning
- Product placement includes advertising through film or media using their brand to gain exposure
