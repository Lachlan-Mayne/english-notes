## Role of HR:
- **Every business employs people**
- Even businesses mostly operated by machinery has some people who oversee the operation
- HR management is all about efficiently managing these resources to help a business meet their long term objectives and overall goals
- **Strategic role:** acquire, develop, maintain, and separate with workers to meet the needs of each of the key business functions

**Outsourcing:**
- Involves the business contracting individuals or companies from outside the business to perform certain business activities
- **Shamrock organisation:** firms have a core workforce, a flexible casual workforce and some outsourced specialists
- Why?
	- Reduce costs
	- Focus on core
	- Improve quality
	- Increase speed to market
	- Foster innovation
	- Conserve capital
- Sometimes HR functions themselves can be outsourced:
	- Acquisition, development, maintenance and separation
- Using contractors has become common for certain tasks where you need specialised workers
- Choice of business to outsource to, but not choice of individual
- Domestic VS Global:
	- Domestic:
		- Same practices and expectations
		- More expensive for experience possibly
	- Global:
		- Cheaper, sacrificing potential skill
		- Different expectations due to different cultures

- Part-time employees have a continuing employment contract and work less than 38 hours per week

## Work Heath and Safety Laws
- WHS act created 2011

- Qantas have to take out insurance, proactively to be ready to support workers who may be injured at work
- Qantas increasing women accepted into the graduate intake and increasing women's participation in their leadership program
- Aim to increase female pilots to 40% within the next decade, which would be significantly above the industry average of 3%.

## Influences:
**Economic:**
- Due to increased level of international competition, businesses are forced to restructure in order to remain competitive 

**Technological:**
- Human resources can be replaced by machines, meaning retrenchment for some, but some new positions can also be made to operate the machinery

**Social:**
- Many workers these days do not want to work full time, leading to a rise in casual and part-time work
- People want more flexibility in their everyday work as well as their career
- More women joining workforce
- People working for longer periods of time
- Ageing population
- Standards of living are increasing

**Qantas:**
- Qantas need to reduce costs to increase profit, however inflation makes workers demand higher pay
- Outsourcing IT and call centres to cut costs, but still train their own pilots

**Good working conditions wand properly motivated staff will lead to increased motivation and performance, leading to being seen in a better light by the community.**
- Staff retention and absenteeism rates improve as staff feel more valued and motivated
- Business costs are reduced and business performance is enhanced
- Best practice employers enjoy regular publicity

## Processes:
1. **Acquisition
3. **Development**
4. **Maintenance**
5. **Separation**

## Acquisition:
- The process of hiring the workers needed to meet business objectives
- Includes determining the labour needs, attracting candidates, and selecting the right people
- Internal hiring:
	- Trusted employees
	- Known skills and experience
	- Save
	- Could be limited in overall potential compared to external
- External hiring:
	- Potential for more specialised labour
	- Better experience possibly
	- Unknown productivity
1. **Recruitment**
	- Finding and attracting the right quantity and quality of staff
2. **Selection**
	- Gathering information about each applicant for a position, then using that info to choose the most appropriate applicant
3. **Placement**
	- Locating the employee in a position that best utilises the skills of the individual to meet the needs of the business

An issue that could arise from a business rapidly expanding and requiring additional staff would be the need for external recruitment as internal would be impossible due to the need for more staff that the business does not have. This could be risky for the business as they would have less of an idea and would need to placing more trust in the staff they are hiring as they are unknown to the business.

## Development:
- Concerned with improving skills and capabilities of employees in order to better meet business goals
- Employees go through induction
- Mentoring and coaching may be used
- Training should be viewed as an investment by businesses, as it aims to seek a long-term change in skills in order to improve work performance in the business
- Managers have a performance appraisal process to monitor the results of the development


If employees are unmotivated and management does not listen to their suggestions, then undergoing a training program for the employees may be a valid human resource management process that would improve the culture of the workplace. 

## Maintenance:
**Maintenance is about motivating, retaining and managing the wellbeing of staff to keep them motivated and committed**
**Communication and culture:**
- Poor communication and culture is often reflected in workplace conflict and high turnover rates

**Employee participation:**

- Separation could put more stress on the pressure the business
- More pressure could result in higher chance of separation with other employees in the business
- **HR must notice and leave entitlements given must comply with legislation and industrial agreements**

## Voluntary:
**Resignation:**
- Employee leaves of their own free will
- Employee decides to leave the business with the intention of finding a new job elsewhere
- Contracts often state that the employee must give a minimum 4 weeks notice in order to reduce business disruption

**Retirement:**
- Choosing to stop working altogether
- Often between ages 60-68

**Voluntary Redundancy:**
- When a business needs to let go of people, but asks for people to nominate themselves first

	- Too many employees
	- Technology replaces staff
	- Demand for products are declining

- Some businesses will avoid the costs and risks associated with possible unfair dismissal claims by during casuals or contractors

## Separation at Qantas:
- As a result of the GFC, increased competition, changes in technology and COVID-19 Qantas have made several large-scale "downsizing decisions"
- 2014-16: -5000 staff

	- Ground operations (1500)
	- Office roles (1450)
	- Cabin crew (1050)
	- Engineering (630)
	- Pilots (220)
- Fair Work Commission awarded a former flight attendant $33,000 in unfair dismissal
- Qantas claimed he had stolen Qantas owned alcohol, which while true, due to the nature of his situation and the long working career for Qantas, he was paid out while not being allowed to work back at Qantas

## Strategies
**Leadership:**
- The way in which decisions are made in the business and how workers are managed

## Leadership Styles:
**Autocratic:**
- Total control over decision-making; decisions are made and communicated to workers
- Decisions can be made quickly
- Clear instructions and structure
- More skilled workers may feel undervalued
- Largely reliant on decisions of 1 person

**Democratic:**
- Employees are consulted in setting objectives and determining tactics and techniques
- Manager has finals decision, but based on suggestions
- Workers feel included and important
- If majority is uninformed, potential negative impact on business

**Laissez-faire:**
- Gives a lot of control and decision making to employees
- Leader outlines goals and basic parameters of what is allowed and expected
- Motivating for employees
- Workers may not reach full potential
- Some workers may be tempted to slack off

**Bureaucratic:**
- Decisions are based on policy guidelines or manuals, so management simply identifies set instructions and communicates them to employees
- Necessary in some industries involving dangerous tasks
- No benefit from skilled workers
- Can feel restrictive on employees

This large retail store uses autocratic leadership management, which gives employees total control over decision making, which while it may have a positive impact on business performance due to the quick nature of decisions being implemented quickly. However, this can make employees feel they are not being listened to. This decreasing worker satisfaction may lead to more employees leaving the workplace, which in the long term would decrease overall output, decreasing profitability of the business.

## Qantas Leadership Style
- **1920-1995: Autocratic**
	- Qantas management had total control over decision making, minimal contact between workers/management
- **1995-2020: Democratic**
	- Due to deregulation of the aviation industry, privatisation made democratic more prominent
	- Qantas employees had more input due to this
- **During Covid-19: Autocratic**
	- Fast-decisions were necessary
	- Collaboration with workers was made more difficult, though some video conferencing has allowed minimal amount
- **Current:**
	- Vanessa Hudson's leadership style may appear to be different to Joyce's, with a focus on listening and collaboration

## Job Design
**The strategy of determining the tasks for workers to carry out in an effort to motivate them.**

## 2 Main Options:
**General Tasks:**
- Giving employees a wider range of tasks in their role, rather than a single repetitive task, will provide more job satisfaction
- Workers more likely to develop wider range of skills

**Specific Tasks:**
- Employees are given a more challenging role and/or one with greater responsibility
- Workers feel more valued and motivated
- Workers who are able to prove themselves may be more likely to be targets for future promotion or extra rewards

## Qantas Job Design
**With employee input, ongoing reviews and feedback, they aim to design jobs more effectively.**

**Qantas use:**
- Job enlargement:
	- Giving their workers more and varied tasks
- Job rotation:
	- Moving employees from one task to another
- Job Enrichment:
	- Allowing employees to assume more accountability, responsibility and independence

## Recruitment
**The process of locating and attracting the right quantity and quality of staff to apply for employment vacancies.**
- The recruitment strategy undertaken for a job vacancy will determine the kinds of people available to hire
- NOT the same as outsourcing
- You can outsource the task/activity of recruitment
- You then have employees but someone else did the finding + selecting

**Approaches:**
- Internal recruitment is when HR decides to fill the vacancy with an existing employee
	- PRO: Known employees
	- CON: Workplace jealousy/disruptions
- External recruitment is when HR fills a job vacancy with people from outside the business
	- PRO: Hire based on experience
	- CON: Misleading, could be unprofessional
- General skills
	- PRO: Interpersonal skills, flexibility, positive attitude
	- PRO: Makes employee able to fill multiple potential roles in the business
	- CON: Not targeted efficiency
- Specific skills
	- PRO: Tailored to the needs of the particular position and may be required - such as a rare skill or a qualification
	- CON: Can only fit targeted sectors

## Training and Development
- Training people either for bettering current skills, or preparing them for future skills, increasing business performance
- Training for future skills provides the business with security
- No immediate payoff for training for future skills
- Qantas Pilot Program at UNSW (Pilot academy)
- Qantas centre for service excellence
- Focus on safety, keeping up their reputation
- Qantas spend $275M annually on training

## Performance Management
**The process of monitoring an employees contribution to the business and taking necessary corrective action.**

**Administrative Approach:**
- "Tick the box" attitude
- Employees do bare minimum and are often brief guidelines on how to improve

**Developmental Approach:**
- Embraces the opportunity to fine-tune employees
- Uses data to develop individual employee skills

## Rewards:
- Monetary
- Non-monetary:
	- Additional leave
	- Better conditions
