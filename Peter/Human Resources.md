- Choice of business to outsource to, but not choice of individual
- Domestic VS Global:
	- Domestic:
		- Same practices and expectations
		- More expensive for experience possibly
	- Global:
		- Cheaper, sacrificing potential skill
		- Different expectations due to different cultures

## Processes:
1. **Acquisition
3. **Development**
4. **Maintenance**
5. **Separation**

## Acquisition:
- The process of hiring the workers needed to meet business objectives
- Includes determining the labour needs, attracting candidates, and selecting the right people
- Internal hiring:
	- Trusted employees
	- Known skills and experience
	- Save
	- Could be limited in overall potential compared to external
- External hiring:
	- Potential for more specialised labour
	- Better experience possibly
	- Unknown productivity
1. **Recruitment**
	- Finding and attracting the right quantity and quality of staff
2. **Selection**
	- Gathering information about each applicant for a position, then using that info to choose the most appropriate applicant
3. **Placement**
	- Locating the employee in a position that best utilises the skills of the individual to meet the needs of the business

An issue that could arise from a business rapidly expanding and requiring additional staff would be the need for external recruitment as internal would be impossible due to the need for more staff that the business does not have. This could be risky for the business as they would have less of an idea and would need to placing more trust in the staff they are hiring as they are unknown to the business.

## Development:
- Concerned with improving skills and capabilities of employees in order to better meet business goals
- Employees go through induction
- Mentoring and coaching may be used
- Training should be viewed as an investment by businesses, as it aims to seek a long-term change in skills in order to improve work performance in the business
- Managers have a performance appraisal process to monitor the results of the development


If employees are unmotivated and management does not listen to their suggestions, then undergoing a training program for the employees may be a valid human resource management process that would improve the culture of the workplace.
