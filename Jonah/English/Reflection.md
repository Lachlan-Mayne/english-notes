The poem "An Irish Airman Foresees His Death" by W.B. Yeats explores anomalies in the airman's motivation, personalising and enhancing the troops' sense of uniqueness while also challenging human experiences. Yeats emphasises what the airman is not motivated by using repeated anaphora, using the phrase "nor" repeatedly throughout the poem. These ideas contradict the status quo since the airman seems fine with his fate. The airman's persona, a soldier who is not bothered by who wins the war, is one way in which these anomalies show a paradoxical emotion toward the poem's ideas.
